A starter repository for c++ development

## Development Container

This repository includes a `.devcontainer` folder that sets up a development container for the project. The development container provides a consistent and isolated environment for development, ensuring that all necessary dependencies and tools are available.

The `.devcontainer` folder contains the following files:

- `devcontainer.json`: Defines the configuration for the development container, including the Docker image to use, extensions, settings, and any other necessary configurations.
- `Dockerfile`: Contains the instructions to build the Docker image for the development container. It specifies the base image, dependencies, and any other setup required for the development environment.
